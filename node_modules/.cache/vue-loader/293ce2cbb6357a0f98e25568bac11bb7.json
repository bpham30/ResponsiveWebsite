In 2015, I began playing around with Photoshop for fun. I kept having fun with it and creating new designs. Eventually, I began doing commissions for designs on the internet as a freelance graphics designer. This only grew my interest even more. While in school, I took a couple classes on graphic design and learned many new skills. Recently, I helped my older brother as an assistant graphic designer for his job.\n          </p>\n\n          <p> \n            Growing up, I was always interested in video games, technology, and computers. One day, my brother introduced me to the world of coding. It interested me, so I started teaching myself from YouTube tutorials. I soon realized that this could be a good career path to follow. In my junior year, I was encouraged to take computer science as a class. I enjoyed the class very much and decided to move forward to AP Computer Science in my upcoming senior year.\n          </p>\n\n          <div class=\"contact-wrapper\">\n            <h2>Contact Me:</h2>\n            <p>bangapham16@gmail.com</p>\n          </div>\n\n    </div>\n  </div>\n",null]}
